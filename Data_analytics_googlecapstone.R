
# MAIN IDEA OF THÄ°S WORK

# We will use an open-source data from Google Data Analytics Certificate to analyze the differences between casual and member users of an bicycle company users.

install.packages(tidyverse) 
install.packages(devtools)      # The devtools package is for github function to call a package from github and tidyverse is a classic package for plenty of useful functions.


install_github("hzambran/hydroTSM")         # I upload hydroTSM package to use "time2season" function.
